### Plotting scripts

Here, I will add python scripts for processing and plotting the `EarthShadow` results. 

At the moment, the script `PlotRates_CRESST_Earth.py` can be used to plot a whole-Earth map of the CRESST-II rate for low mass DM.

More scripts (for plotting orthographic projections, animations etc.) will be added soon.
