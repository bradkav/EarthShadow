## Diurnal Modulation Animations

Here, you will find animations showing the event rate in a CRESST-II-like detector as a function of time. In all cases, the DM mass is 0.5 GeV, with DM-nucleon interaction strength set to give a 10% average scattering probability.

These animations can be viewed *in browser* on [FigShare](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3575630.v1).

#### Whole-Earth maps

Files beginning `moll` show Mollweide projections of the whole Earth. We show results for three NREFT operators: O1, O8 and O12. Files ending in `_noD` only take into account attenuation, not deflection. The remaining videos include both deflection and attenuation.

#### Local maps

Files beginning `ortho` show Orthographic projections centred on particular locations on the Earth. These are:

- `LNGS`: Gran Sasso Laboratory, Italy (latitude 42 N)
- `INO`: India-based Neutrino Observatory, India (latitude 10 N)
- `SUPL`: Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, Australia (latitude 37 S)
- `CJPL`: China Jinping Underground Laboratory, China (latitude 28 N)

For the local maps, we include both attenuation and deflection in all cases.
