## Annual Modulation Animations

Here, you will find animations showing the event rate in a CRESST-II-like detector as a function of time. 
We show results for three NREFT operators: O1, O8 and O12.

Files ending in `_noD` only take into account attenuation, not deflection. The remaining videos include both deflection and attenuation.
