### Code

The main `EarthShadow` code. It is currently written in *Mathematica*, but we may include implementations in other languages in the future (in part because *Mathematica* generally disagrees with me). We'll also add more code for analysing and plotting the results soon.

To get started, simply open the `EarthShadow-Examples.nb` notebook!

*More detailed documentation to come.*
